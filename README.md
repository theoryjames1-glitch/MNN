# MNN

Thank you for your patience! Now that I understand your request clearly, let's move forward with the following:

### **Key Concept Recap**:

* **Markov coefficients** (which are treated as the **weights**) evolve over time.
* You want to **add noise mutations** and **dithering** to the process, similar to how leaky neurons behave, allowing the network to **explore** more effectively during training.

### **Noise Mutations and Dithering**:

1. **Noise Mutations**: This refers to **random noise** added to the inputs of the network, helping it explore the parameter space.
2. **Dithering**: This is added to the output, serving as a form of **stochastic filtering** or **perturbation**, ensuring the network avoids overfitting and enhances generalization.

We'll add these effects to the neural network, making them **trainable parameters** that evolve as part of the network's learning process.

### **Corrected Network with Noise Mutations and Dithering**:

Here’s the updated implementation where:

* The **weights** (Markov coefficients) evolve during training.
* **Noise mutations** are added to the inputs.
* **Dithering** is added to the outputs, similar to leaky neurons.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# ----- Markov Coefficients as Learnable Parameters with Noise Mutations and Dithering -----
class MarkovNoisyNeuron(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(MarkovNoisyNeuron, self).__init__()

        # Markov coefficients (weights) as learnable parameters
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_size, output_size))  # These are the Markov coefficients
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(output_size))  # Bias for the layer

        # Noise and dither parameters (learnable)
        self.noise_factor = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.05))  # Noise applied to inputs (mutation)
        self.dither_strength = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.05))  # Dither applied to outputs

    def forward(self, x, epoch):
        # Apply noise to inputs (mutation effect)
        noise = torch.randn_like(x) * self.noise_factor
        x = x + noise

        # Linear transformation (weighted sum of inputs)
        output = torch.matmul(x, self.weights) + self.bias

        # Apply dithering to outputs (stochastic filter)
        dither_noise = torch.randn_like(output) * self.dither_strength
        output = output + dither_noise

        return output


# ----- Markov Neural Network (MNN) with noise mutations and dithering -----
class MarkovNoisyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MarkovNoisyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = MarkovNoisyNeuron(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = MarkovNoisyNeuron(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x, epoch):
        x = self.layer1(x, epoch)
        x = F.relu(x)   # Non-linearity needed for XOR
        x = self.layer2(x, epoch)
        return x


# ----- XOR dataset -----
X = torch.tensor([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[0], [1], [1], [0]], dtype=torch.float32)

# ----- Model -----
model = MarkovNoisyNetwork(input_size=2, hidden_size=4, output_size=1)

# Criterion and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()  # Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.005)  # Optimizer adjusts Markov coefficients (weights)

# ----- Training -----
num_epochs = 10000
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(X, epoch)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Monitoring the progress
    if (epoch + 1) % 1000 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch [{epoch + 1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

# ----- Testing -----
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    predicted = torch.sigmoid(model(X, num_epochs))  # Apply sigmoid for binary output
    print("\nRaw outputs:\n", predicted)
    print("Rounded predictions:\n", predicted.round())  # Rounded predictions for binary output
```

### **What's New in This Version?**

1. **Noise Mutations**:

   * Each neuron adds **random noise** to its input data. This introduces **mutation** to the input, helping the network **explore** different solutions during training.
   * The **noise factor** (`self.noise_factor`) is a **learnable parameter**, meaning the model can adjust the amount of noise dynamically during training.

2. **Dithering**:

   * **Dithering** is applied to the neuron’s **output**, introducing small random perturbations. This helps to **stabilize the learning process** and **improve generalization** by preventing the model from overfitting to precise outputs.
   * The **dither strength** (`self.dither_strength`) is also a **trainable parameter**, allowing the model to learn how much noise to add during output processing.

3. **Trainable Parameters**:

   * Both the **noise factor** and **dither strength** are **learnable parameters**, evolving through training via **backpropagation**.
   * These allow the network to **optimize** how much **exploration** (noise) and **stabilization** (dithering) is necessary to perform well on the task.

---

### **How This Improves the Learning Process:**

1. **Noise Mutations**:

   * By introducing **random noise** into the inputs during training, the network is encouraged to **explore** different solutions, potentially avoiding getting stuck in local minima. The amount of noise is **learned** by the network, allowing it to adapt its exploration strategy.

2. **Dithering**:

   * The **dithering** added to the output helps ensure that the network doesn't **overfit**. It makes sure that the network doesn’t learn overly deterministic outputs but instead learns **robust representations** that generalize well to new data.

3. **Self-Optimization**:

   * The **noise** and **dithering** parameters are **learned by the network itself**, so the network can decide the best level of **exploration** and **regularization** needed to solve the problem.

---

### **Conclusion**:

In this updated **Markov Neural Network (MNN)**:

* **Noise mutations** are added to the **inputs**, introducing randomness (mutation) to explore the solution space.
* **Dithering** is applied to the **outputs** to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
* Both **noise** and **dithering** are **trainable parameters** that evolve during training, just like the traditional weights in a neural network.

This implementation allows the network to **learn how much noise and dithering to apply**, making it **adaptive and self-optimizing** as it trains.

Let me know if this now meets your expectations, or if you'd like to explore further adjustments!
